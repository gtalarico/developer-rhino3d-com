Compute is an open-source online advanced geometry extension as a web service based on Rhinoceros 3d's RhinoCommon API. The Compute services are meant to compliment the Rhino3dm Geometry library. See the [Compute website](https://www.rhino3d.com/compute) for more overview information.

Compute can be accessed from CPython, JavaScript and C# (.NET).  It runs on many platforms including Windows, OSX, IOS, Unix, All major browsers and Node.JS.

## Setting up a Compute Project

There are a few tools which are essential to communicate with the Compute server. Select one of the supported languages:
- [Python](compute-python-getting-started) -  The CPython wrapper for [OpenNurbs](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/opennurbs/) which contains the functions to read and write Rhino Geometry Objects. This is available as a Pip package.
- [JavaScript](compute-javascript-getting-started) - The Javascript library and web assembly (WASM) to access Compute through any major browser or Node JS.
- [C# (.NET)](compute-net-getting-started) - The nuget packages required to access to the Rhino3dm and Compute API.

## Support

The libraries are still very new and changing rapidly. Give them a try or get involved. Ask any questions or share what you are working on the [Compute Discussion Forum](https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/serengeti/compute-rhino3d)
